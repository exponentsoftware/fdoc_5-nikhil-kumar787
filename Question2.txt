The main difference between forEach and filter is that forEach just loop over the array and executes the callback but filter executes the callback and check its return value.
As the name already suggest reduce method of the array object is used to reduce the array to one single value.
Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. While both regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner, there are certain differences between them.
Syntax:-
var add = function(x, y) {
  return x + y;
};
// ES6
let add = (x, y) => { return x + y };

The method find() is very similar to findIndex() . The only difference is that the find method returns the element value, but the findIndex method returns the element index.

I will use filter method to filter out one object element in an array .

var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped. var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope.
